# Dzaan

Was found guilty of murdering some mercenaries, this was burned at the stake in [Easthaven](../Places/Ten%20Towns/Easthaven/Easthaven.md). He supposedly found some treasure.

We found his simulacrum which we later helped resurrect into the real Dzaan.

Has an assistant called [Krintaas](Krintaas.md).
