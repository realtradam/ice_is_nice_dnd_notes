We arrested and interrogated him. Worked for [Durth Sunblight(dead)](People/Durth%20Sunblight(dead).md).
Told us:
- There is a hidden fortress in the mountains currently known as [Xardorok's Fortress](../Places/Xardorok's%20Fortress.md).
- Told us that the ferry they payed for([[Scython]]) has a map leading to this fortress.
- Told us the fortress has a forge made of a dragon heart.
- [Xardorok Sunblight](Xardorok%20Sunblight.md) has another son, [Nildar Sunblight](Nildar%20Sunblight.md), who commands a secret outpost on the northeast side of [Kelvin's Cairn](../Places/Kelvin's%20Cairn.md)
