# Charles

Headless man, husband of [Cynthia](Cynthia.md). Had a letter that had this written:

The letter wrote how she wishes to see her husband Charles once more, and how she understands that he is trying to find food to feed their family with, but it is difficult for the kids to grow up without a father, and hopes he reaches back home to Bremen safely and swiftly, as she misses him dearly.

We later found his head around a yeti that we fought and defeated.
