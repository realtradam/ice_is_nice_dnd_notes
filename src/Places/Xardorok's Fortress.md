# Xardorok's Fortress

Secret fortress hidden in the mountains. Belongs to [Xardorok Sunblight](../People/Xardorok%20Sunblight.md). We know where it lies as we found a secret map leading to it.

Has a forge powered by still-beating heart of a red dragon. In this forge, [Xardorok Sunblight](../People/Xardorok%20Sunblight.md) is crafting a dragon made of chardalyn, with which he plans to destroy the Ten Towns. The chardalyn dragon is close to being finished.
