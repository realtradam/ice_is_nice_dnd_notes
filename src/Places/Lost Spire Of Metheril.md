# Lost Spire Of Metheril

Piece of the floating castle known as Metheril. It appears to have broken off and embedded itself into the ground.

The rune chamber that brought back [Dzaan](../People/Dzaan.md) to life can also be used for illusionary objects or creatures. However this one is damaged so it might not work properly.
