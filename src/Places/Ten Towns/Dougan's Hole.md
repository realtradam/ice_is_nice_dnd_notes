# Dougan's Hole

- Learned from the barkeep in [Good Mead](Good%20Mead.md) that people live in fear of winter wolves that are the size of horses and smarter then normal wolves.
- Lots of people are incestuous in this town.
- Lead by the speaker [Edgra Durmoot](../../People/Dougan's%20Hole/Edgra%20Durmoot.md).

## Twenty Stones of Thruun
Standing at the southern edge of town, nineteen of these crudely fashioned granite menhirs are arranged in a rough triangle, with a single stone at the formation's center. No one knows who built this structure or why; the townsfolk maintain that the stones were there when the town's founder, a Chondathan named [Dougan Dubrace(dead)](Dougan%20Dubrace(dead).md), first happened upon this fishing spot. Scholars have tried to research the origin of the structure's name, but all they have found are allusions to a creature named [Thruun](../../Religions/Thruun.md) in the oldest legends of the northern folk. Some speculate that [Thruun](../../Religions/Thruun.md) was a god, while others believe it's a destructive elemental spirit bound to this location by ancient druidic magic.
