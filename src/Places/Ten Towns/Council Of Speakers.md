# Council Of Speakers

Each town is an independent settlement that elects a leader, or speaker, to represent its interests at meetings of the Council of Speakers, which are infrequent and take place at the Council Hall in [Bryn Shander](Bryn%20Shander.md). These meetings are called to discuss matters of shared interest and to settle disputes between towns.
