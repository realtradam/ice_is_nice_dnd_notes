# Easthaven

One of the towns that performs the ritual sacrifices.

We entered this town right when the red wizard [Dzaan](../../../People/Dzaan.md) was burned at the stake.

[Imdra Arlaggath](../../../People/Easthaven/Imdra%20Arlaggath.md) is the captain of the Easthaven militia. Explained the reasons [Dzaan](../../../People/Dzaan.md) was burned at the stake. Gave us information about the treasure [Dzaan](../../../People/Dzaan.md) found([Dzaan's Treasure](../../../Quests/Completed/Dzaan's%20Treasure.md)), in return we needed to help the town find [The Missing Fisherman](../../../Quests/Completed/The%20Missing%20Fisherman.md).

## Weird Statue

There is a weird statue in the speaker hall. This object is actually the figurehead of a ship and is carved in the likeness of a winged demon. It stands 8 feet tall. A band of adventurers used a telekinesis spell to raise the figurehead from the depths of [Lac Dinneshere](Lac%20Dinneshere.md) a few months ago and hauled it to Easthaven, hoping for a reward. What they got was hardly worth the effort, and Speaker [Danneth Waylen](../../../People/Easthaven/Danneth%20Waylen.md) doesn't know what else to do with the figurehead except store it here, out of the public eye. He fears the figurehead is tainted by demonic magic and has warned his staff not to touch it.

We determined it is indeed a desecrated object.

When we went to inspect it at night, we found some Gray Dwarves taht broke into the speaker's hall, killed the guards, and were trying to steal pieces of the statue. We defeated the Dwarves and captured one of them. The main dwarf [Durth Sunblight(dead)](People/Durth%20Sunblight(dead).md) was killed. We captured the one named [Klaska](../../../People/Klaska.md).

There was also a crying wet ghost near the statue. We ignored her for hours until we were ready to speak to her where she initiated combat against us. We defeated her.

The following morning we arrested and interrogated [Klaska](../../../People/Klaska.md). 

## White Lady Inn

We talked to a bard called [Rinaldo](../../../People/Easthaven/Rinaldo.md) that told us about [The White Lady's Treasure](../../../Quests/The%20White%20Lady's%20Treasure.md). He then let us do a seance with the White Lady. We asked her if we could defeated [Auril the Frostmaiden](../../../People/Auril%20the%20Frostmaiden.md) and if we could get the location of the treasure(asked this in at least 4 different ways). The White Lady said no to all the above.
