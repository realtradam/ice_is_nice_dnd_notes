- Barkeep told us about the [Wizard to be Burned](../../Quests/Wizard%20to%20be%20Burned.md) in [Easthaven](Easthaven/Easthaven.md).

## Shrine of the Flaming Sword
- Where the body of the [Kendrick](../../People/Kendrick%20Rielsbarrow.md) was laid to rest.
- [Jewo Flasted](../../People/Player%20Characters/Jewo%20Flasted.md) learned the following lore of this shrine:
	- The shrine was built over a century ago, when the town's rivalry with [Dougan's Hole](Dougan's%20Hole.md) raged so fiercely that the lake, a frequent battlefield, became known as Redwaters. For a time thereafter, nearly all residents of Good Mead paid homage to [Tempus](../../Religions/Tempus.md). Today, the shrine's relevance has dwindled to the point where it's mainly used just for town gatherings.
