# Wizard to be Burned
## Status: In Progress

[Dzaan](../People/Dzaan.md) was burned at the stake in [Easthaven](../Places/Ten%20Towns/Easthaven/Easthaven.md). We got a clue that he has hidden [Treasure](Completed/Dzaan's%20Treasure.md) and its location from [Imdra Arlaggath](../People/Easthaven/Imdra%20Arlaggath.md). When we got there we found his simulacrum and [Krintaas](../People/Krintaas.md). They asked us to help resurrect him and so we did.

[Dzaan](../People/Dzaan.md) then asked us to keep and eye out and defeat the 3 mages from the [Arcane Brotherhood](../Companies&Groups/Arcane%20Brotherhood.md).

He is searching for hidden location of [Ythryn](../Places/Ythryn.md) so that he could plunder it.

[Dzaan](../People/Dzaan.md) also has a strange timer above his head only visible to [Huitzilopchtli(Huwie)](../People/Player%20Characters/Huitzilopchtli(Huwie).md).
