# Finding the Casks of Mead
## Status: Complete

## Intro:
- [Kendrick Rielsbarrow](../../People/Kendrick%20Rielsbarrow.md) was murdered defending this mead.
- Was stolen by [Doug the Veeg Marauder(dead)](../../People/Finding%20the%20Casks%20of%20Mead%20Quest/Doug%20the%20Veeg%20Marauder(dead).md) and [Friend the Ogre(dead)](../../People/Finding%20the%20Casks%20of%20Mead%20Quest/Friend%20the%20Ogre(dead).md)
- In an attempt to find the mead, a search party was sent but went missing.

## Resolution:
- Ran into [Fef](../../People/Good%20Mead/Fef.md) who found the missing search party all dead. He was running back to [Good Mead](../../Places/Ten%20Towns/Good%20Mead.md) in a panic.
- We found the militia. Followed the tracks from the search party to where [Doug](../../People/Finding%20the%20Casks%20of%20Mead%20Quest/Doug%20the%20Veeg%20Marauder(dead).md) lives.
- While following the tracks encountered a [Chwinga](../../Creatures/Chwinga.md), where we attempted to hunt it and mistook it for a fox.
- Eventually reached [Doug's Lair](../../Places/Doug's%20Lair.md), where we discussed about potential alternative solutions but he was not having it.
- Fought [Doug the Veeg Marauder(dead)](../../People/Finding%20the%20Casks%20of%20Mead%20Quest/Doug%20the%20Veeg%20Marauder(dead).md), [Friend the Ogre(dead)](../../People/Finding%20the%20Casks%20of%20Mead%20Quest/Friend%20the%20Ogre(dead).md) and a bear and defeated them.
- Obtained the legendary "Doug's Spear" as well as other various loot.
- [Gahg the Veeg Marauder](../../People/Finding%20the%20Casks%20of%20Mead%20Quest/Gahg%20the%20Veeg%20Marauder.md) showed up. Convinced her that [Doug the Veeg Marauder(dead)](../../People/Finding%20the%20Casks%20of%20Mead%20Quest/Doug%20the%20Veeg%20Marauder(dead).md) murder suicided himself and friends.
- We found a broken wagon and [Huitzilopchtli(Huwie)](Huitzilopchtli(Huwie).md) fixed it.
- We collected and kept all the sheep and goats.
- Went back into town and turned in quest, thus completing it.
