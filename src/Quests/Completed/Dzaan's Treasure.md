# Dzaan's Treasure
## Status: Complete

A treasure that [Dzaan](../../People/Dzaan.md) supposedly found. Told to us by [Imdra Arlaggath](../../People/Easthaven/Imdra%20Arlaggath.md). Eventually we found the entrance to this location and entered it. We found out this place is known as [Lost Spire Of Metheril](../../Places/Lost%20Spire%20Of%20Metheril.md). Here we found a lot of lore in the library:

1.  **Magical Wonders of Netheril**. This book is a collection of interviews with Netherese archmages, who discuss their studies of ancient elven magic and the creation of mythallars. The book includes sketches of such devices. A mythallar looks like an enormous crystal ball held in an ornate cradle. The globe sheds bright light in a 300-foot radius and dim light for an additional 300 feet. The globe draws magic from the Weave that can be harnessed for various purposes. For example, Netherese mages used mythallars to keep their cities aloft and empower their magic items. The bigger the mythallar, the more magic it can hold. The largest mythallars are 150 feet in diameter.
2.  **Mysteries of the Phaerimm**. This book sheds light on the [Phaerimm](../../Creatures/Phaerimm.md)-telepathic, funnel-shaped monsters of malevolent intellect that lurk in the Underdark-and includes disturbing sketches of them.
3. **Wizards in the Hollow**. The birth of the Netherese empire is chronicled in this otherwise dull, plodding story about the lives of three Netherese wizards.
4. **Ajamar's Guide to the Phantastic**. This breezy, lighthearted treatise on illusion magic was required reading in many Netherese classrooms. It describes clever ways to use common illusion spells.
5. **The Unfettered Mind**. This lunatic text discusses how one might exist solely as a disembodied brain, preserved for eons in a magical suspension fluid. It includes sketches of brains in jars.
6. **From Shadow, Substance**. This speculative work discusses how one might harness the Weave to turn an illusory object or creature into its real counterpart, with commentary and criticism from noteworthy Netherese illusionists.
7. **Here Lies the King**. This elaborately plotted novel features an illusionist who uses magic to impersonate a prince, supplant a king, rule a fictional kingdom for sixty-one years, and fake his own death.
8. **Ventatost**. This book uses testimonials and conspiracy theories to piece together events leading up to the destruction of a Netherese city called Ventatost, which disintegrated as it flew over the forest of Cormanthor nearly two thousand years ago, before the fall of [Ythryn](../../Places/Ythryn.md).
9. **Lost Scrolls of Sabreyl**. Written in Elvish

Found a room of silence. We found an amulet that we didn't pick up until later. We finally met [Dzaan](../../People/Dzaan.md)'s simulacrum and [Krintaas](../../People/Krintaas.md). They asked us to help them resurrect [Dzaan](../../People/Dzaan.md) and we did. We got rewarded for this with some money and a book that disintegrated.

We later picked up the amulet.
