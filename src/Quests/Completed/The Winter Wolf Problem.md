# The Winter Wolf Problem
## Status: Complete

Wolves that kidnapped and bothered [Dougan's Hole](../../Places/Ten%20Towns/Dougan's%20Hole.md)
- 2 Wolves
	- [Koran(dead)](Koran(dead).md)
	- [Kanan(dead)](../../People/Dougan's%20Hole/Kanan(dead).md)
Koran attempted to trick us but we saw through it and fought them both. Once they started losing [Kanan(dead)](Kanan(dead).md) ran away for help while [Koran(dead)](Koran(dead).md) tried to hold us back and slow us down. After defeating [Koran(dead)](Koran(dead).md) we turned him into a pelt.

Following the footsteps we were eventually led to the lodge where the wolves were hiding out. Using the wolf pelt as a disguise we trick the other wolf into showing us where the kid prisoners are being held. We then let the kids out and tricked the remaining wolf into the cage where we locked him up and then defeated him as well.

- Searched the remaining area and found a goat statue.
- Found a frozen hacked up corpse of a frost giant.
- Found a [Chwinga](../../Creatures/Chwinga.md) stone statue.
- Found 3 icewind kobolds([Snorp, Holgi, Zilbo](../../People/Dougan's%20Hole/Snorp,%20Holgi,%20Zilbo.md))
	- They say the [Chwinga](../../Creatures/Chwinga.md) startled them, so they killed it and it turned to stone.
- Found barrels of whale oil
- Found goo of a [Remorhaz](../../Creatures/Remorhaz.md) worm

Encountered a mammoth. Failed to convince him to let us take his things so we burned him alive.

Destroyed the entire structure by destroying an ice rune.

Returned the kids to their mom: [Hilda](../../People/Dougan's%20Hole/Hilda.md)
