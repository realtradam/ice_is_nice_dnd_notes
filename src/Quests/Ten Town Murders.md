# Ten Town Murders
## Status: In Progress

- A string of murders happening in the Ten_Towns
- [Hlin Trollbane](../People/Good%20Mead/Hlin%20Trollbane.md) told us:
	- [Sephek Kaltro](../People/Sephek%20Kaltro.md) to be the cause of these murders. He works for a company called [Torg](../Companies&Groups/Torg.md)
	- He is suspected to be doing the work of [Auril the Frostmaiden](../People/Auril%20the%20Frostmaiden.md) as the victims all drew lots to be sacrificed, and they tried to cheat their way out so they supposedly murdered by [Sephek Kaltro](../People/Sephek%20Kaltro.md).
	- [Hlin Trollbane](../People/Good%20Mead/Hlin%20Trollbane.md) would like proof of him doing these things.
